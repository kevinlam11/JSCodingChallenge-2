// In this challenge, you’ll have a function that takes an array as input and returns an array. But if all goes according to plan, it’ll remove the negative numbers. This is another example of a task that’ll be useful when combing through data and looking for clever ways to eliminate “bad data.”
function array(x, y, z) {
  // array checks if each argument is a positive number using our typeOf keyword
  if ((typeof x, y, z >= 10000)) {
    console.log("Yep. They are all positive numbers ");
  } else {
  }
}

array();
